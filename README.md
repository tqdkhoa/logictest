# QUESTION EASY 1
Implement a method easy1 that given an integer array, which each element appears twice except for one. Find that one

Example #1<br>
Input: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]<br>
Output: 3 <br>

Example #2<br>
Input: [-1, 2, 4, 2, -1]<br>
Output: 4<br>
## Solution

# QUESTION MODERATE 1
Implement a method moderate1 that given an array of integers nums, returns an array of integers output where output[i] = product of all elements in nums except nums[i]

Example<br>
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]<br>
From the example, output[1] = product of all elements in nums except nums[1] which is 1 * 3 * 4 = 12

## Solution
